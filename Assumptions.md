Assumptions

Soil quality did not significantly degrade over time
Fertiliser type has minimal effect on yield
The average of daily temperatures from March-July has the greatest impact on yield
Seasonal average temperature affects yield and not the full year's average temperatures
Annual Average rainfall is representative of corn planting season rainfall
Farms under study are not irrigated
