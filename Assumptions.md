Assumptions

Soil quality did not significantly degrade over time
Fertiliser type has minimal effect on yield
The average of daily temperatures from March-July has the greatest impact on yield
Seasonal average temperature affects yield and not the full year's average temperatures
Annual Average rainfall is representative of corn planting season rainfall
Farms under study are not irrigated
The effect of pests is negligible as farms use adequate pest control measures
No extreme weather phenomena occur 

simplifications
to ensure the model is tractable:
Seasonal averages were used in place of monthly averages for fertilizer and temperature
